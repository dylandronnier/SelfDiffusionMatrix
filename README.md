# SelfDiffusionMatrix


Computation of the Self-diffusion matrix using Monte-Carlo methods

## Theory


## Monte-Carlo techniques

The big issue arising in the computation of the coefficient by Monte-Carlo technique is

Here is an example of plot for some density obtained by using a naive approach :

## Variance reduction

### Control Variates

### Antithetic Variates

### Stratification

## Another approach

This approach is based
